# AI Fluency for Builders: From Zero to Your First AI-Augmented Tool

## Course details

AI is everywhere – but most teams still struggle to use it in practice. You don't need specialist knowledge to start experimenting.

This masterclass gives you the confidence to build and test a working AI-powered tool, even if your organisation hasn't yet found the "right" use case.

We'll use a straightforward example – documenting software decisions – as the vehicle. Step by step, you'll connect to open models, refine prompts, review outputs, and guide AI towards results you can trust.

By the end, you'll have walked through the full workflow of building with AI – and gained the fluency to explore in your own context.

No prior AI experience required – just curiosity, a decent dev machine, and a working setup (instructions shared in advance).

## Who can benefit

- Developers and technical practitioners curious about AI
- Comfortable with git and reading TypeScript/JavaScript
- Teams that want confidence to explore AI, even without a business case in hand

## What you'll achieve

- How to treat AI as a collaborator, not a magic box
- Plugging open models (ollama + LangChain) into a working scaffold
- Iterating on prompts and fixing failure cases
- Guiding AI reasoning: generating options, weighing trade-offs, reviewing outputs
- Principles you can transfer to docs, testing, support, or other workflows

## Getting Started

1. Follow the setup instructions in [docs/STEP_00_SETUP.md](docs/STEP_00_SETUP.md)
2. Run `yarn test` to verify your environment
